# Prompts

This directory contains the versioned prompt files used throughout the development of AI-powered applications in this repository.

Prompt engineering is not a one-shot activity. It is an iterative process that directly impacts model performance, output quality, reproducibility, and system behavior. Treating prompts as first-class artifacts is essential for maintaining consistency and traceability over time.

### Purpose

The goal of this folder is to:
	•	Maintain version control over prompt evolution
	•	Track refinements and structural changes
	•	Preserve experimental variations
	•	Improve reproducibility of model behavior
	•	Support systematic evaluation and benchmarking

### Why Version Prompts?

In AI systems, prompts function as behavioral specifications. Small wording changes can significantly alter outputs. Without versioning:
	•	Model responses become non-reproducible
	•	Debugging becomes difficult
	•	Performance regressions go unnoticed
	•	Iterative improvements cannot be tracked

Versioning prompts ensures transparency and accountability in the development process.
