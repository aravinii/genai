# Gen AI
Hands-on exploration of Generative AI through structured courses, experiments, and applied projects.

Over the past few years, the field of Generative AI has evolved at an unprecedented pace. What once lived primarily in research papers and benchmarks is now embedded in APIs, SDKs, and real-world products. Models have become more capable, more accessible, and more integrated into practical systems.

Amid this acceleration, I decided not only to follow the trend, but to deepen my understanding in a structured way. This repository is the result of that effort: a hands-on journey through courses, experiments, and applied projects designed to move beyond surface-level usage and into implementation, evaluation, and system design.

Most of the material here is based on the [5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course with Google](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai) (which I will reference in more detail in the subsequent folder), and you will find notebooks extracted and adapted from it. These cover foundational concepts as well as more advanced patterns for building applications with generative models.

As a capstone project, I developed an AI agent focused on the São Paulo real estate market. The agent is designed to help users:
	•	Understand what it is like to live in specific regions of São Paulo
	•	Interpret the current market conditions
	•	Estimate the price of a potential property

Users provide descriptive information about a property, and the agent returns a price estimate along with contextual insights. The goal was to combine generative reasoning with structured information to create a practical, user-oriented application.

This repository serves both as a structured learning record and as an applied experimentation lab for Generative AI systems.
